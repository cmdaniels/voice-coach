Perfect your pronunciation.

Pronunciation makes the difference between one who knows the language well and one who could pass off as a native speaker. Voice Coach helps you decipher between similar sounds that are hard to reproduce for non-natives. Use a microphone to practice your accent or develop your listening skills in different game modes.
